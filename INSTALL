libaff4 2.0.1

Requirements:
-------------

C++11 compiler (gcc/clang/Visual Studio 2015+)
zlib
snappy
libraptor2
liblz4
cppunit (tests only)
openssl (tests / examples only)
doxygen (documentation).

General Installation (*nix):
----------------------------

With all dependencies installed, typically, a user can:
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

And libaff4 will be installed into /usr/local/

To override installation location, use the --prefix option, and compiler
selection may be made using environment variables as passed to ./configure.

General Installation (Windows):
-------------------------------

Solution files for Visual Studio 2015 are located in /win32.

See /win32/INSTALL.txt for full details if needing to rebuild dependencies.


General Installation (macOS):
-------------------------------

Xcode/Clang is required for build/installation.

With all dependencies installed, typically, a user can:
$ ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -O2 -g0" LDFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -L/opt/local/lib"
$ make
# make install

Notes: The additional flags are required to assist ./configure in finding
snappy, and ensuring the build utilises clang as the compiler.
